# What are Data Structures?

Data structures are specialized formats for organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. They provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. They are critical to programming and are used in almost all software systems including web development, operating systems, image editing, and much more. Some common types of data structures are arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, trees, and graphs. The choice of the data structure often begins from the choice of an abstract data type, a broad type encapsulating various possible data structures."

# Why are Data Structures Important?

Data structures are crucial in the field of computer science and coding because they offer a method of organizing and storing data in an efficient and manageable format. They're critical because they form the foundation for modern algorithm design. Your ability to choose or design the most suited data structure for a particular task can be the difference between a solution that's functional and efficient and one that isn't. They allow data to be processed in a variety of ways - stored, sorted, ordered, or accessed - which is integral to software or database development. By implementing effective data structures, programmers can enhance performance, ease coding procedures, allow flexibility of data and most importantly, reduce complexity of code in a significant manner.
