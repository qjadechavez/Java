# What is an Array?

An array in Java is a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements of the same data type. It allows you to store multiple values in a single variable and access them using an index, which starts at 0.

### Key Characteristics

- **Fixed Size**: The length of an array is determined at the time of creation and cannot be resized.
- **Type Safety**: All elements must be of the same data type (e.g., all int, all String).
- **Zero-Based Indexing**: Elements are accessed using indices starting from 0 up to n - 1.
- **Default Values**: If not initialized, elements are automatically set to default values (e.g., 0 for int, null for objects, false for boolean).
- **Exception**: Accessing an invalid index (e.g., outside the array bounds) throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Arrays are objects in Java, stored in the heap memory, and once created, their size cannot be changed. They are useful for handling a group of related data items efficiently.
