# What is Object Oriented Paradigm?

A conceptual framework or philosophy for designing software, where the system is modeled as a collection of objects that interact with each other. These objects combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods). '*more general rather than object oriented programming and is language-agnostic*'

**Core Principles**:

1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods, restricting direct access to ensure data integrity.
2. **Inheritance**: Allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another, promoting reuse.
3. **Polymorphism**: Enabling objects to be treated as instances of a common type, with different behaviors.
4. **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential features and hiding irrelevant details.
