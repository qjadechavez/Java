# What is Object Oriented Paradigm?

A conceptual framework or philosophy for designing software, where the system is modeled as a collection of objects that interact with each other. These objects combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods). '*more general(conceptual) rather than object oriented programming and is a language-agnostic*'

**Core Principles**:

1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods, restricting direct access to ensure data integrity.
2. **Inheritance**: Allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another, promoting reuse.
3. **Polymorphism**: Enabling objects to be treated as instances of a common type, with different behaviors.
4. **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential features and hiding irrelevant details.

**Purpose**: To create modular, reusable, and maintainable systems by modeling real-world entities or abstract concepts.

**Example:**

**Member.java**
```
package com.qjadechavez;  
  
class Member {  
  
    // Field initiation  
    private String name;  
    private String type;  
    private int level;  
    private int rank;  
  
    // Constructor  
    public Member(String name, String type, int level, int rank) {  
        this.name = name;  
        this.type = type;  
        this.level = level;  
        this.rank = rank;  
    }  
  
    // Getter Method  
    public String getName() {  
        return this.name;  
    }  
  
    public String getType() {  
        return this.type;  
    }  
  
    public int getLevel() {  
        return level;  
    }  
  
    public int getRank() {  
        return rank;  
    }  
}
```

**Team.java**
```
package com.qjadechavez;  
  
public class Team {  
  
    Member[] members;  
      
    private Team(Member[] members) {  
        this.members = members;  
    }  
  
    // Method to display team members  
    public void displayMembers(String teamName) {  
        System.out.println(teamName + " Members:");  
        int memberCount = 1;  
        for (Member member : this.members) {  
            System.out.println("Member " + memberCount + ":");  
            System.out.println("  Name: " + member.getName());  
            System.out.println("  Type: " + member.getType());  
            System.out.println("  Level: " + member.getLevel());  
            System.out.println("  Rank: " + member.getRank());  
            System.out.println();  
            memberCount++;  
        }  
    }  
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
  
        Member member1 = new Member("John", "Light", 2, 3);  
        Member member2 = new Member("Jane", "Dark", 4, 5);  
        Member member3 = new Member("Jill", "Dark", 1, 1);  
        Member member4 = new Member("Jack", "Light", 3, 2);  
          
        Member[] team1Members = {member1, member2};  
        Team team1 = new Team(team1Members);  
  
        Member[] team2Members = {member3, member4};  
        Team team2 = new Team(team2Members);  
    
        team1.displayMembers("Team 1");  
        team2.displayMembers("Team 2");  
    }  
}
```
