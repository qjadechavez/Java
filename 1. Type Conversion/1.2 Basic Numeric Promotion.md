# What is Basic Numeric Promotion?

**Basic numeric promotion** in Java is a set of rules that automatically **convert smaller numeric types to larger ones** when performing operations (like addition, subtraction, etc.) involving different data types. This ensures consistency and avoids data loss.

**Source Code:**
```
public class BasicNumericPromotion {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        char char1 = 1, char2 = 2;  
        short short1 = 1, short2 = 2;  
        int int1 = 1, int2 = 2;  
        float float1 = 1.0f, float2 = 2.0f;  
  
        // char1 = char1 + char2;  
        // ❌ Error: char1 + char2 becomes int, so assigning it back to char causes a type mismatch.  
        
        // short1 = short1 + short2;
        // ❌ Error: same thing—short + short becomes int, can't assign directly back to short.  
        
        int1 = char1 + char2;  
        // ✅ OK: char1 and char2 are promoted to int, and result is stored in int1.  
        int1 = short1 + short2;  
        // ✅ OK: short1 and short2 are promoted to int.  
        int1 = char1 + short2;  
        // ✅ OK: char and short both promote to int.  
        float1 = short1 + float2;  
        // ✅ OK: short is promoted to float.  
        int1 = int1 + int2;  
        // ✅ OK: int + int stays as int.    
    }  
}
```
